- Hi, my name is Tianze Quan, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. I hold a joint Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Data Science from NYU, where I developed a strong foundation in machine learning, statistical modeling, and optimization.

Professionally, I’ve worked across diverse roles—from building generative models at Alibaba’s Modelscope, to conducting competitor analysis at Shopee, and developing real-time financial sentiment dashboards at a fintech startup. I also bring experience in venture analysis, having sourced and evaluated over 200 startups during my externship with HP Tech Ventures.

Technically, I’m proficient in Python, SQL, and Tableau, with hands-on experience in NLP, clustering, time-series EDA, and simulation modeling. My past projects include COVID-19 research summarization using BERT and fraud detection through exploratory data analysis and PCA.

I’m passionate about leveraging data to drive real-world decision-making, and I’m currently looking for opportunities to apply my skills in data science, analytics, or strategy.
