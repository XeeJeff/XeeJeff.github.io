- <strong> NYU - Covid-19 Research Summarization Project </strong>\
Applied clustering techniques like KMeans and SOM to dynamically group topics and visualized them using word clouds\
Developed model to summarize COVID-19 research papers in BERT, improving accessibility to key findings in vast datasets\
Achieved 0.85 BERTScore on topics, ensuring high-quality summaries that aid researchers in quickly

- <strong> Kaggle - Credit Fraud Detection </strong>\
Converted the data type through pre-processing on 285K PCAed data to identify relationship in features and fraud via Python\
Found the peak-time of the fraud cases via EDA to understand the time fraud transactions occurred using bi-variate analysis\
Conceptualized the differences about the time and amount in fraud and legitimate transactions through visualization

- <strong> NYU - Capstone Project | Artwork Rating Prediction </strong>\
Performed data preprocessing and EDA on 300 artwork data to understand association between user preference and artworks\
Built a linear regression model with 0.07 R-square on the artwork data as the benchmark model to predict user preference\
Implemented PCA to transform the original data to perform the clustering by K-means and identify the similarity in artworks
